;;; insert.el --- Template for new Emacs Lisp files

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file serves as a template for creating new Emacs Lisp configuration files.
;; It provides the standard structure with proper file headers and footers.
;;
;; Template Variables:
;; - `(buffer-name)` - Expands to the current buffer name
;; - `(replace-regexp-in-string "\.el$" "" (buffer-name))` - Buffer name without .el extension
;;
;; This template is likely used by auto-insert mode or similar templating systems.

;;; Code:

;; Template content would be inserted here when creating new files

(provide 'insert)

;;; insert.el ends here
