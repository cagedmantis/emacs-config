;;; gnu_linux.el --- Linux specific configuration

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file contains Linux-specific configurations for Emacs.
;; Currently minimal, but serves as a placeholder for future
;; Linux-specific customizations.
;;
;; Potential areas for Linux-specific configuration:
;; - Font configuration (different from macOS defaults)
;; - Keyboard modifier mappings
;; - Clipboard integration
;; - Package manager integration
;; - Desktop environment specific settings

;;; Code:

;; Currently no Linux-specific configurations are needed
;; All settings are handled by the cross-platform modules

(provide 'gnu_linux)
